#R SENTIMENT ANALYSIS LOOP THROUGH ALL THE DOCX FILES OF THE LAWS
#This task can be done for every other step, I used here the proposal docs, then you can do the same by substituting with the others
#For the parliament I used a doc of all the summaries in the excel file, for the commission response we already had it
#The first two tasks are the most important, try with a few docx proposal in your R working directory and see how it goes
#Remember, I had problem if a lot of package are open, try to do this with only sentimentr and officer open
